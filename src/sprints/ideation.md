# Initial Brainstorming

## Kinetic Sculptures

Early on in our brainstorming session, several clear themes emerged. The first was
around kinetic sculptures. Works by [BREAKFAST](https://breakfastny.com/) and [Anthony
Howe](https://www.howeart.net/) were inspiring to see, and we wanted to build something
similar. In particular, the way that most BREAKFAST pieces were comprised of many
smaller pieces, [each with their own individual
movement](https://breakfastny.com/works/cedar-point-reeds), was fascinating to see and
strongly affected our final direction.

## Computational Art

At the same time, we were looking at different computational art pieces on places like
[Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/). Computational art felt like it felt our
project well:

- Pieces often came with [a sense of dynamic
  motion](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/767279) that would map well to a kinetic
  sculpture
- Pieces would [take user input](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/413567) and use it in
  different ways
- Pieces were generally composed of [smaller elements moving
  independently](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/156580) similar to BREAKFAST pieces

## Sustainability

A final emerging theme was a focus on sustainability, either as something to consider
while building the project or something to drive the artistic direction of the project.
We did consider the latter for a while - having a project that somehow responded to data
about sustainability at Olin seemed like an interesting project. However, we in the end
we decided that focusing on sustainability in our process would be more interesting and
allow us to explore more ideas. 

# Ideas

## Flip Disks

Our first pitch was to make a smaller version of a [BREAKFAST flip-disc
display](https://breakfastny.com/flip-discs) or a [BREAKFAST Brixels
display](https://breakfastny.com/brixels) that responded dynamically to human movement.
We liked the idea of having mechanical components that could be individually addressed
by software, especially with breadth of options it gave us when designing how people
might interact with it. Our MVP would be a 8x8 grid of "mechanical pixels", each
controlled by a motor or magnet, all controlled by an arduino hooked up to a webcam.
Further, we wanted to source all of our material sustainably - we had contacted a local
recycling facility and gotten permission to use whatever materials we wanted that they
had.

## Kinetic Rain

Unfortunately, our initial idea fell apart when it came time to put together out budget
estimate. We couldn't figure out how to source 64 motors with $250, so we had to pivot.
Our next idea followed similar principals, and was inspired by a piece called [Breaking
Wave](https://bea.st/breaking-wave). We would still have many individually moving
components, but now they would be grouped together along axles, bringing us down to only
8 required motors. With our idea decided, we moved on to start building our a proof of
concept in Sprint 1.
