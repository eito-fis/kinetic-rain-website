At the end of Sprint 2, we had the start to our final piece, but it was clear some
components weren't going to work. Our frame was made of a mix of PVC and wood, and our 3
shafts were made with two interconnected shafts of metal we had scavenged.
Unfortunately, these components weren't strong enough for what we needed - the PVC bent
under the weight of the axles, and the 3D printed connector holding the shafts together
bent under the weight of the pulleys. Worse, the software side positional tracking for
motors wasn't accurate at all, and we were reliant on manual stops to prevent the
pulleys from winding too far up. We would have to tackle these obstacles in our last
sprint.
