By the end of Sprint 3, we had overcome the issues identified in the previous sprint and
had a strong start for our final structure. The frame was converted to be entirely made
of wood, the shaft was welded and mounted, and weights made of street sign were attached
to the pulleys. Our software was also integration tested and ready to go, with a full
pipeline from the mounted webcam to the Python software to our Arduino. An important
software feature for this sprint was support for the  DIY encoders we designed - this
allowed us to run the sculpture with minimal safety concerns. We ended the sprint with a
successful test. It was clear that our concept was going to work in this form factor.
Now, we just needed to finish manufacturing.
