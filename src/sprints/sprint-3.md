# Deliverable

By the end of Sprint 3, we had overcome the issues identified in the previous sprint and
had a strong start for our final structure. The frame was converted to be made entirely
of wood, the shaft was welded then mounted, and weights made of street sign were
attached to the pulleys. Our software was also integration tested and ready to go, with
a full pipeline from the mounted webcam to the Python software to our Arduino. An
important software feature for this sprint was support the DIY encoders we designed -
this allowed us to run the sculpture with minimal safety concerns. We ended the sprint
with our first test of our what we hoped would be our final configuration. Now, we just
had to scale up and finish manufacturing.
