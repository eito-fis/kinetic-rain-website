Leading up to Demo Day we leaned hard into manufacturing and assembling the
final piece - the goal was to get from our single Sprint 3 shaft, to a full 8
shafts. To accomplish this, we:
- Got every shaft welded
- Attached all pulleys to shafts
- Tied all jellyfish to pulleys
- Attached all shafts to the frame.

On the morning of Demo Day, we had all 8 shafts mounted, and were ready to go.
Then, disaster struck. Our shafts weren't fully secured to the motor / shaft
interfaces and several fell off, damaging components in the process. We
scrambled to replace the broken pieces. And, by the end of our demo period we
had 6 shafts back up, running and reacting!
