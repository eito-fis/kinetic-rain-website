We are team TEAM NAME HERE, and for [PIE 2021](http://poe.olin.edu/) we put together a
large-scale, responsive kinetic sculpture made of recycled materials. Our goals were
keep sustainability in mind while working on something that was visually appealing,
responsive to the viewer, and challenging to make.

<br/>

Safe to say, we accomplished what we set out to achieve.
